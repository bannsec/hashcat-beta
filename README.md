# Overview
Little wrapper around hashcat so it can be installed via pip. Attempts to also correctly determine which binary you should run and adds `hashcat` to your path.

For the actual hashcat, please go to: https://hashcat.net/hashcat/

NOTE: This version is meant to run the beta release of hashcat, and thus may be unstable. If things don't work, try the normal hashcat.

# Quickstart
```bash
$ pip install hashcat-beta
$ hashcat -h
```
